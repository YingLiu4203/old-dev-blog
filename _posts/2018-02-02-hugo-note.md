Hugo is a static website generator writting in Golang. It can be used for a blog website, a documentation site, a landing page. This is a study note based on the [official Hugo doc](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the [Youtube Hugo tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3).

# Overview

## Features

Hugo is fast at building static pages (less than 1ms per page). It is cross platform and has good theming support.

For site organization, it proivdes customizable URLs, taxonomies including categories and tags, content sorting, automatic TOC, dynamic menu and permalink pattern.

It supports multiple content syntaxes including multipel markdown variants and rich content. It generates content summaries automatically.

It integrates with Disqus, Google Analytics, RSS, multiple HTML templates, and syntax highlighting powerered by Pygments.

## File Structure

Hugo has the following files/folders structure.

* `archetypes/`:  it has the templates used to create new pages. A template defines a set of front matter fields.
* `config.toml`: the configuration file.
* `content/`: all content for your website. The content has different sections -- a section represents a content typat that has its own directory under the `content/` directory.
* `data/`: it stores configuration files or data templtes that pull from dynamic content.
* `layouts/`: store view templates for all content types. View templates include list pages, homepage, taxonomy templates, partials, and single page templates.
* `static/`: this stores all static assets such as images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. All files in this folder are copied over as-is.

## Configuration

Hugo can read configuration from a configuration file or from enviornment variables. You can also configure the builtin markdown engine.
